## Alignment with Production Targets

### 25% Livestock Production Increase

**Services Supporting Target:**
- ✅ Artificial insemination (improve genetics)
- ✅ Veterinary services (reduce mortality)
- ✅ Slaughterhouse facilities (enable processing)
- ✅ Environment control rebates (intensive farming)
- ✅ Duty-free feed and equipment imports

**Pathway to 25%:**
1. Improve genetics through AI → +10% productivity
2. Reduce mortality through vet services → +5%
3. Increase intensity (more animals per farm) → +10%
4. Total potential increase: ~25%

### 25% Produce Production Increase

**Services Supporting Target:**

- ✅ Irrigation services (year-round production)
- ✅ Extension services (improve yields)
- ✅ Plant protection (reduce losses)
- ✅ Cold storage (reduce post-harvest loss)
- ✅ Irrigation rebates (capital investment)

**Pathway to 25%:**
1. Increase planted area → +10%
2. Improve yields through extension → +10%
3. Reduce losses (pests, post-harvest) → +10%
4. Irrigation enables multiple crops per year → +15%
5. Total potential increase: ~30-45% (exceeds target)

### 5% Fish Production Increase

**Services Supporting Target:**
- ✅ Proper vessel registration and maintenance
- ✅ Safety certification (more fishing days)
- ✅ Haul-up facilities (reduce downtime)
- ✅ Sustainable management (protect stocks)

**Pathway to 5%:**

**Strong Support For:**
- ✅ Livestock production (9 services, rebates, veterinary)
- ✅ Crop production (14 services, extension, materials)
- ✅ Fisheries management (14 services, comprehensive regulation)

**Adequate Support For:**
- ✅ Agricultural inputs (rebates, duty-free)
- ✅ Technical assistance (extension, research)
- ✅ Processing and markets (facilities available)

**Needs Strengthening:**
- ⚠️ Agricultural finance (loans, credit)
- ⚠️ Risk management (insurance)
- ⚠️ Land access (allocation programs)
- ⚠️ Export facilitation (certification, marketing)

**Realistic Assessment:**
With current services, government targets are achievable IF:

2. Financial constraints are addressed (loans/credit)
3. Land access improves for new farmers
4. Markets absorb increased production
5. Import competition is managed

The 25%-25%-5% targets are ambitious but realistic with full service utilization and additional support in finance and risk management.
