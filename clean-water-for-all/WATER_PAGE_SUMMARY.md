## What's MISSING (Critical Gaps)

### ❌ NO BWA Services Found:

The goal is "Resolve brown water issues and increase access to piped water" but the dataset contains:

**NOT FOUND:**
- ❌ Water connection applications
- ❌ New piped water installation
- ❌ Brown water complaints/resolution
- ❌ Water pressure issues
- ❌ Water main repairs
- ❌ Water infrastructure improvements
- ❌ Water supply expansion projects
- ❌ Water meter installation/replacement
- ❌ Water quality complaints
- ❌ Water line extensions

**Why Missing?**
BWA (Barbados Water Authority) is a separate entity and their customer service/connection services are not in the government service registry.

| Increase Food | 35 | ⚠️ Some gaps (credit) |
| **Clean Water** | **9** | **❌ SEVERE GAPS** |

## What the 9 Services Actually Support

### These services DO help with water goals:

1. **Water Quality Testing** - Can test water samples if citizens suspect contamination
   - Useful for: Brown water quality verification
   - But: Citizens must bring samples themselves

2. **Water Bill Assistance** - Financial help for poor families
   - Useful for: Affordability/access
   - But: Doesn't help if no piped water exists

3. **Climate Services** - Rainfall/drought predictions
   - Useful for: Water resource planning
   - But: Doesn't directly help citizens

4. **Agricultural Water Rate** - Farmers can get special rates
   - Useful for: Farming only
   - But: Not for household water

5. **Toilet/Bath Permit** - Permission to build indoor plumbing
   - Useful for: New construction
   - But: Assumes water connection exists

6. **Irrigation Services** - Government provides irrigation water
   - Useful for: Agriculture only
   - But: Not for household drinking water

### Verdict:
These 9 services are **peripherally related** but do NOT address the core goal of resolving brown water and increasing piped water access.

## The Reality

### To Actually Achieve the Goal:

**Citizens Need:**
1. Contact BWA directly for water connections
2. Contact BWA for brown water complaints
3. Contact BWA for water infrastructure issues
4. Contact Ministry of Transport, Works & Water Resources for major infrastructure projects

**These services are NOT in the registry.**

### What This Page Shows:
- Supporting services (water testing, bill assistance)
- Agricultural water services (not household water)
- Planning tools (climate data)

**What This Page CANNOT Show:**
- How to get piped water installed
- How to report/fix brown water
- How to apply for water connection
- How to request water infrastructure improvements

## Page Features

### ⚠️ Prominent Warning Box

The page includes a red warning box at the top clearly stating:

```
⚠️ CRITICAL SERVICE GAPS

The following essential water services are NOT found in this service registry:
• BWA - Water connections, piped water installation, brown water complaints
• Water main repairs and replacements
• New piped water connections for homes
• Brown water issue resolution services

For water connection and supply issues, contact BWA directly.
```

### Categories (5):
1. Water Quality Testing & Monitoring (2)
2. Water Bill Assistance (1)
3. Water Resource Planning (2)
4. Plumbing & Sanitation Permits (1)
5. Irrigation (Agricultural Water) (3)

---

## What Should Be Done?

### Option 1: Add BWA Services to Registry
The government service registry should include:
- Water connection application process
- Brown water complaint process
- Water infrastructure request process
- Water meter services
- Water main repair requests

### Option 2: Clear Referral Information
If BWA services stay separate, the registry should include:
- Link to BWA website
- BWA contact information
- Clear referral instructions

### Option 3: Note the Gap
Keep the page as-is with prominent warning that core services are elsewhere.

**Current page uses Option 3** - clearly states the gap.

---

## Honest Assessment

### Goal Achievement Potential: ❌ Very Limited

With only 9 peripheral services:
- **Cannot** help citizens get piped water installed
- **Cannot** help citizens resolve brown water issues
- **Cannot** expand piped water access
- **Can** help with some testing and bill assistance

### This is a DATA PROBLEM, not a service problem.

The services probably exist (BWA provides them) but they're not captured in this spreadsheet.

---

## Recommendation

**DO NOT deploy this page without context.**

Users expecting to find "how to get piped water" or "how to fix brown water" will be confused and frustrated.

**Better approaches:**
1. Add a note: "For water connection and supply services, visit BWA website"
2. Include BWA contact information prominently
3. Explain that this page shows only supporting services
4. Consider not creating this page until BWA services are added to registry

## Files Delivered

✅ **goals-water-CORRECTED.html** - 9 services, EXACT data from spreadsheet

**Warning included:**
- Red warning box about missing BWA services
- Clear notice that core water services are elsewhere
- Only shows what's actually in the spreadsheet

---

## Summary

**Service Count:** 9 (smallest of all goals)  
**Core Goal Services:** 0 (none address piped water/brown water directly)  
**Data Quality:** Accurate to spreadsheet but massively incomplete  
**Usefulness for Citizens:** Limited - mainly shows testing and bill assistance  
**Major Gap:** ALL BWA services missing  

**This page accurately reflects the spreadsheet data, but the spreadsheet data is severely incomplete for this goal.**
