## What Citizens CAN Actually Do (From This Page):

### ✅ Birth & Death Registration (Well-Covered):
- Register births and deaths
- Apply for birth certificates
- Apply for death certificates

- Get repeat prescriptions
- Check in at hospital (let them know you're here)

### ✅ Public Health (Administrative):
- Port health forms (travel/immigration)
- Apply for medical practice certificate (doctors)
- Medical screening for children
- Medical forms for immigration

### ✅ Patient Support (Minimal):
- Apply for psychosocial support
- Complete patient experience survey

### ❌ What Citizens CANNOT Do:

- Access medical records
- View test results
- Get lab/diagnostic services
- Request specialist referrals
- Find ambulance service
- Access vaccination services

## Data Quality Issues

### Issue 1: Only 4 Real Patient-Facing QEH Services
Of the 7 "QEH services":
- 4 are citizen-facing (prescriptions, check-in, information, medication delivery)
- 3 are internal staff forms (resumption of duty, leave, travel)

**This is extremely limited** for a major hospital.

### Issue 2: Zero Polyclinic Services
The goal mentions "QEH/Polyclinics" but **ZERO polyclinic services** are documented.

Polyclinics provide:
- Primary care consultations
- Child health clinics
- Maternal health (antenatal/postnatal)
- Chronic disease management (diabetes, hypertension)
- Vaccinations
- Health education
- Elderly care

**None of these are in the registry.**

### Issue 3: Birth/Death = 36% of Services
- 15 of 42 services (36%) are birth/death registration
- These are vital statistics, not healthcare services
- Important but not about "improving patient outcomes"

### Issue 4: Port Health = Travel Admin
- 5 services are port health (travel health declarations)
- These are border control/immigration, not patient care
- Not relevant to hospital/polyclinic quality

## How This Helps Achieve the Goal

### Goal: "Improve service quality and patient outcomes"

**What These 42 Services Actually Do:**

**✓ Helpful (Minimal):**
1. Repeat prescriptions (reduces wait times)
2. Medication delivery (convenience)
3. Patient experience survey (feedback for improvement)
4. Psychosocial support (mental health)

**≈ Neutral/Administrative:**
- Birth/death registration (vital statistics, not patient care)
- Port health forms (border control)
- Medical certificates (employment/immigration)
- Staff forms (internal HR)

**✗ Missing (Everything Else):**
- Appointment booking
- Medical records access
- Clinical services
- Polyclinic services
- Emergency services
- Diagnostic services
- Treatment information

**Verdict:** These services DO NOT significantly help "improve service quality and patient outcomes."

**Other Administrative:** 7 services (16%)

**Critical Gaps:**
- ZERO polyclinic appointment services
- ZERO QEH appointment services  
- ZERO medical records access
- ZERO diagnostic service booking

**Likelihood of Achieving Goal with These Services:** Very Low

Most healthcare services are delivered directly by QEH and polyclinics without being documented in this government service registry.
