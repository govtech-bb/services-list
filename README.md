# Services list — Government of Barbados

[https://govtech-bb.github.io/services-list/](https://govtech-bb.github.io/services-list/)

A small static website (two pages) that lists government services and goals.

Quick start

- Open `index.html` or `goals.html` in a browser for a local preview, or run a simple static server from the repo root:

  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```

- `goals.html` contains an in-page dataset (`goalData`) and working examples of filtering and rendering.
- `index.html` is mostly a UI shell and needs the same filtering/rendering logic ported or a `services.json` data file.
