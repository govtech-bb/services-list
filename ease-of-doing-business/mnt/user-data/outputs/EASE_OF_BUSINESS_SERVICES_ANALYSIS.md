**Key Services:**
- CARICOM Rights of Establishment (for CARICOM nationals)

**Notable Gap:** The dataset appears to be missing:

## Critical Gaps Identified

### Missing Core Services:

1. **Business Registration/Incorporation**

## User Journey: Starting and Operating a Business

**Typical Path:**
1. ❓ **Register business** → Missing general registration service
2. ✅ **Register for taxes** → Enable persons to register for taxes (BRA)
3. ❓ **Get business license** → Sector-specific licenses available
4. ✅ **Hire staff** → Work Permits (if foreign workers needed)
5. ✅ **Import/Export** → ASYCUDA World registration and clearance
6. ✅ **File taxes** → Corporation tax, VAT returns via TAMIS
7. ❓ **Get certification** → Product certification available (BNSI)

**Pain Points:**
- Step 1 (business registration) not clearly identified
- Step 3 (general business licenses) sector-dependent
- Utility connections not covered
