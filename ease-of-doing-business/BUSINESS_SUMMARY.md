## ⚠️ Important Gaps Identified

### Critical Services Missing from Dataset:

1. **Business Registration/Incorporation**
   - Company registration
   - Business name registration  
   - Partnership registration
   - **→ Likely exists through CAIPO (Corporate Affairs & Intellectual Property Office)**

2. **Intellectual Property**
   - Trademark registration
   - Patent applications
   - Copyright registration
   - **→ Should be with CAIPO**

3. **General Business Licenses**
   - Retail licenses
   - Service business licenses
   - Professional practice licenses
   - **→ May be ministry-specific**

4. **Utilities**
   - Business electricity (BL&P)
   - Commercial water (BWA)
   - **→ Need to contact utility companies**

### Why These Gaps Matter:
These are **fundamental business formation services**. Their absence suggests they weren't captured in the original spreadsheet data collection, but they almost certainly exist.
