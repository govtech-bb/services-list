## Can This Achieve the Goal?

### ❌ NO - Not Even Close

**You cannot grow a heritage economy with 13 services.**

A heritage economy requires:
- Artists making a living from their art ❌
- Heritage sites attracting tourists ❌
- Creative industries employing people ❌
- Cultural events generating revenue ❌
- IP being monetized ❌
- Skilled cultural workforce ❌

**NONE of these ecosystem components are supported.**
