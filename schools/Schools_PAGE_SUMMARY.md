## Data Quality: ⚠️ 30% Are Administrative Forms

### The Issue:

**58 of 194 services (30%) are internal administrative forms:**
- Leave forms for teachers/principals
- Travel authorization for school staff
- Requisition forms for school supplies
- Equipment request forms
- Duty resumption forms
- Various school administrative forms

**These are NOT citizen-facing services.** They're internal school/ministry operations forms for staff.

### What This Means:

**Real Citizen-Facing Services:** ~136 services (70%)
**Internal Administrative Forms:** ~58 services (30%)

**Still Excellent:** Even after removing admin forms, 136 citizen-facing services is still the SECOND LARGEST collection (after More Jobs with 161).

4. **Scholarship opportunities** (local and international)

- Supports special needs students
- Opens international opportunities
- Enables school choice (placements, transfers)

**What's Still Needed for Full Transformation:**

## Special Note: Administrative Forms

### Why So Many Admin Forms? (58 forms)

**Likely Reasons:**
1. **Internal digitization:** Government digitizing internal processes
2. **School autonomy:** Individual schools have their own forms
3. **Different school types:** Primary, secondary, tertiary each have forms
4. **HR processes:** Leave, travel, resumption forms for all staff

**Are They Useful?**
- **For schools:** Yes - streamlines operations
- **For citizens:** No - not relevant
- **For transformation:** Indirect - better school operations = better education

**Should They Be on Goals Page?**
Debatable. They support education but don't directly help students/parents achieve educational goals.
